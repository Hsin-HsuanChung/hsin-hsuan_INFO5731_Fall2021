      "This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there‚Äôs a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it‚Äôs illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllllüòç. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there‚Äôs a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn‚Äôt work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its üíØ percent honest.\n",

      "Phone was ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù but arrived looking brand new and with 100% battery capacity. Sadly, it has not turned out to be a good buy. Shortly after the return window closed, the phone began having audio and messenger issues. I am now only able to talk in short intervals of 1-5 minutes before the outgoing voice capability drops. I can still hear the person on my phone but they cannot hear me. A quick redial and all is ok again but only for a short time. First few times it happened, I could shutdown phone, power up and the problem would disappear for a few days. Not so any longer. Comes back as quickly as first call after power up. Haven‚Äôt been able to discern a pattern for length of call. Seems to randomly go out. Sometimes it will last 5 minutes, sometimes 45 seconds. iMessage also randomly converts to SMS. Quick restart seems to correct that issue but phone doesn‚Äôt seem to recover iMessage function without restart once it drops. Everything else seems to (at least right now) work as it should. Tired of dealing with it so I am back in the market for a new iPhone.\n",

      "2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again... Or else, monthly payments on a NEW phone may no longer look as optional... :(\n",

No trouble operating. Needed updating to the latest iOS. The only disappointing part is the Battery Condition. These Renewed phones are guaranteed to come with batteries that have at least 80% capacity left. Mine came in at 81%. So technically its acceptable but unfortunately I will be spending another $50 soon for a new battery because it does not last under a day of light/moderate use. SO don't think you are getting a nice iPhone 8 at $177. It will cost you more like $230 when all is said and done.\n"

The seller send me a grapevine in a very good price, if you don‚Äôt feel like dropping $800-$900 on a new phone as I have done in my last two iPhones I would highly recommend purchasing it from here as I am super happy, and I am very careful when it comes to electronics purchasing online, thank you Amazon I appreciate your business and thanks for amazing product.\n",

The generic lightning cable and power brick look and perform just like authentic products. What a great way for me to get an iPhone for work without having to spend the $$ for the newest model. For $199, I now have an iphone for work so that I can check email and calendar. I still use my Android, but my work only allows iPhones for exchange access due to Apple's stringent security updates.

Secondly the housing was replaced with a cheap Chinese reproduction. Lastly the Screen had several major flaws, that held at two arms length could be easily seen. Finally I will say battery heath was a disappointing 86% This phone is at best worth $130-40 dollars. It is a iphone and it has 256gb flash that is the only high point. I do not like to give bad reviews, but well I am a bit upset that seller under estimated me and expected me to be happy.\n",

These are specific for either the GSM or CDMA networks, which are two different types of cellular technologies used by the major carriers (Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, ect). CDMA compatible phones do not work on GSM networks and vice versa. So it's a misnomer to say that any phone which is exclusively GSM or CDMA is \"Fully Unlocked\"- because it will literally be incompatible on a hardware level with about have of the carriers. I was sent the A1905 model of the iPhone 8 (at the time of purchase there was no indication of what model was being sold- just \"Fully Unlocked\") and this particular model is incompatible with the Sprint network.

This paper discussed generalized parabolic cylinder function (or GPCF) distribution i (or GPCFD) probability density function (pdf) in a manner that is original and never presented before in the literature. For GPCF the closed form expression of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) is given by means of series expansion of the four Kamp√© de F√©riet functions and six confluent hypergeometric series of two variables. Numerical results are derived for each case to validate the theoretical models presented in the paper.']\n"
